Task name:

OTP verification using an SMS message

Task definition:

You have to create a website registration which requires a phone number. The number should be validated, and the client wants to use the OTP (one time password) as a solution to that problem. To put it short, you have to send an actual text message to that phone, with a generated code which should be inserted in a validation form.

Task requirements:

- Create a user registration page with the following fields -> an email, a phone, and a password.

- Make sure that we have a well formatted phone.  The customer may enter a number using special characters, e.g. 0885 (34-53-95). As you can see, the country code is missing, and since we need it, you have to prepend it if it is missing. Based on the previous example, the final and valid phone number should look like this: 359885345395.

- You have to create a validation of the phone number by sending a code to the provided number (How: You can mock an SMS provider by saving the messages in the database).

- Make sure that the user can only make 3 attempts to enter the validation code. If all three of them are wrong, add a 1 minute "cooldown".

- Create an option which can allow the system to send a new code to the customer. Make sure that this option is available only when at least 1 minute has passed since the original verification code was sent.

- Keep a log of all verification attempts.

- After a successfully validated phone number, we have to send a confirmation SMS message, saying "Welcome to SMSBump!"

Note: Developing the task in native PHP(or without using the built-ins of the frameworks) is considered as an advantage.
